Design Patterns review

Singleton:
I agree with this design pattern seeing as on the class ExternalFileTypes we only want one object of the class (identified on the getInstance method), which makes this design pattern an ideal solution here.

Template method:
I do not agree with this design pattern identified by my colleague since there is not a template method in the abstract class.
The template method responsibility is to execute the steps of a specific algorithm.
This steps are methods in the abstract class (abstract or not) and their implementation differ in each subclass.
